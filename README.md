# robotic-car

Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create an RC car applying the fundamentals we learned in
PWW and transistors. In addition, we will be developing a 3D model of the RC car which is
going to be constructed using 3D printing when it is possible. The model will be used as a base
for learning actuators and sensors in future lessons.

Design Constraints
Hardware :
2 wheel tank drive mode
Use small gear Motors less than 500 mA to drive your wheels
Chassis must be within 8 x 5 inches

Software:
Must be able to make swing and point turns
Variable speed drive system
Brake and coast mode

Communication:
Accept serial input command
Advanced Communication:
Bluetooth HC05 or RF



Management:
1. Form a team and establish some type leadership rules
2. Assign tasks for team members
3. Create a gantt chart for the project with group member responsibilities (2 weeks)
Phase #1:
Structure design:
Construct the 3d model using the autodesk inventor
Step 1: Download all step CAD files of your parts
Step 2: Create the chassis using the download components

RC Car Project

Step 3: 3D Print the chassis
Step 4: Assemble the components
Note : Use the design process you have learned in the CIM class to guide you through the
different phases of the design
Software design:

1. Get datasheet for the components
2. Get the component specs and extract the pinout information
3. Test your components to see if they are working appropriately (use the
multimeter and the power supply)
4. Learn the theory of operation of the components
5. Build the thinkerCad simulator of the actual system
6. Create testing program for these components
7. Figure out the driving modes and make function to perform these tasks
8. Test your functions

Phase#2:
Final assembly:

1. Wire the components and harness the circuit
2. Troubleshoot and test the circuit using the testing programs created before
3. Program the RC car system to perform the desire tasks
4. Evaluate and test the RC car
5. Modify if necessarily

Phase#3:
Documentation:
1. Create a report explaining the design phases and provide the following:
● Design idea
● Modeling
● Technical drawing
● Mechanical assembly
● System design
● Circuit schematics
● Pictorial diagram
● Wire harnessing
● Programming
● Troubleshooting guide.
● BOM
● References / datasheet
2. Create a repository for the CAD files and the programs
